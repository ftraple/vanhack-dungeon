## **How to  play**

All dungeon levels are randomly generated (rogue-like). Each time you enter the game the labyrinth will be different.

You will be able to find items inside the barrels. All items are randomly chosen too, you will need a lot of luck to finish all 20 levels and save the goddess Juju.

All monsters move only when you move, if they see you, you will be chased. If you don't have the strength to defeat them, you can try to run away.

**TIP:** When approaching monsters try to hit them first on your turn.
